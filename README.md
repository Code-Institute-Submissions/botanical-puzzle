## Scope/ Structure
-----------------------------------------

### Sections & features to be included:
* Home Page: easy to see button for the game, and option to find out more about the topic and this project.
* About section: Describe the resources used for the project, give credits to the images used in the project and give the user the opportunity to find out more/ learn more about the topic. Includes a link direct to the game.
* Instructions: Clearly explainm how to play the game using a series of cards.
* Game: The user is shown a 'token' image of a wild plant, and a large plant map containing images of many different plants. The user must utilise this cue to identify and locate the wild plant on the plant map. If they click on the wrong plant, a modal appears asking them to Try Again. If they click on the correct pant, a correct sound chimes, a modal appears giving the name of the plant they have just located, and their score increases by one point. The aim of the game is to find 20 plants in this way. At the end of the game, the user is shown a table containing all the plants they located during the game, with a thubnail image, plant name, and short description of the plant.
The user can then navigate back to the homepage, where they can find out more on the topic, or they can play again. As there are over 100 plamnts on the plant map and the images are randomly generated, they will discover a different selection of plants each time they play.

**Client perspective:** The homepage is informative and easy to navigate. The game is clearly explained and provides an interesting educational experience. The background sounds enhance the user experience, providing a topical and relaxing soundtrack to their 'wild plant forage'. They will learn about familiar and not so familiar plants from the British Isles, and gain an interest in the environment around them.

**Business perspective:** The homepage provides an opportunity to promote the materials and information behind the project and allows the user to easily navigae to the game. The game provides a wide variety of information on different plants and promotes a positive association with the plant life they are learning about. This is helped by the experience-oriented soundtrack and calming atmosphere. They will learn about familiar and not so familiar plants from the British Isles, and gain an interest in and appreciation of the environment around them.

## Features to be implemented


## Technologies Used

* This project uses HTML and CSS programming languages.
* [Gitpod](www.gitpod.io) was used as the IDE whilst building the webiste.<br>
* [GitHub](www.github.com) The project was developed in Gitpod and then committed and pushed to its GitHub respository, from where this website can be deployed.
* [BootstrapCND v4.4.1](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com) Bootstrap was used for the structure and responsiveness of the - website, for responsive components i.e the navigation bar, and for button functionality.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) The website uses Google fonts for font styling.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) provided the icons in this project.
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.photoshop.com/en) was used to create the wallpaper image and edit the images used in this project.
* [W3C Validation service](https://validator.w3.org) was used to check HTML.
* [W3C Markup validation services](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used to check CSS.
* [JavaScript]


_**Notes on media queries in CSS file:**_
*I have chosen to leave media queries inline instead of putting them at the bottom of each section or the bottom of the document as a matter of preference; I have decided to do it this way because I find it easier to see exactly how each element is being changed at each breakpoint and therefore easier to edit the code if necessary.*


## Deployment

The site is developed in GitPod IDE, from where changes are committed and pushed to the master branch in the Github repository.
This site is hosted using GitHub Pages, which publishes the website directly from the master branch in the Github repository. The website is automatically updated on GitHub Pages when changes are made to the master branch.

To set up GitHub Pages, create a GitHub account and create a new repository by clicking the 'Repositories' tab and then 'new'. Once your GitHub repository is set up (for this to work, the landing page must be named index.html) click 'Settings' and scroll down to the subheading 'GitHub Pages' from where you can publish the site.

*This site can be viewed at https://sophie-apples.github.io/botanical-puzzle/.*

To clone this repository and run it locally:
1. Click 'Clone or download' and copy the page ( https://github.com/sophie-apples/botnaical-puzzle.git )
1. Create a new repository and run Gitpod, or navigate to the directory where you want this cloned directory to be made.
1. Open Git Bash and type **git clone https://github.com/sophie-apples/botnaical-puzzle.git** into the terminal. Press enter and the clone will be created.
